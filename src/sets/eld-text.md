## ELD Keywords

- _Adventure_. There are some creatures with Instant adventures, but these will just be treated as Instants. There may be times that you don't want to give them value from the Instant adventures, but that may not be a problem.
- _Adamant_. You will just need to be aware of the cards that may change effect based on their mana. Be aware of cards that can add any type of mana, such as `Rosethorn Acolyte // Seasonal Ritual`

Drawing two cards a turn is the theme for the blue/red colour pair in this format. Cards such as `Faerie Vandal`, `Bloodhaze Wolverine` and `Irencrag Pyromancer` have abilities that trigger upon drawing your second card. This section contains instant-speed draw spells and abilities.
