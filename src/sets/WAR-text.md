## General WAR things

- Proliferate. There are no instants with proliferate, but watch out for onboard tricks involving cards such as Karn's Bastion, Merfolk Skydiver, Martyr for the Cause (+sacrifice effect) etc.
- Amass. Instant speed can pump a Zombie Army token, luckily there are only two cards: Commence the Endgame and Lazotep Plating.

## Miscellaneous Post-Combat Plays

- Kasmina's Transmutation (can kill things with 1 damage on them)
- Massacre Girl
- Vraska's Finisher

## Sweepers

Opponents may make weird attacks with small creatures if they're going to play a sweeper post-combat. The presence of Vraska's Finisher at common does make it a bit scarier to eat a small creature with one of your big ones, however.

- Time Wipe
- Widespread Brutality
- Solar Blaze?

## Flash Creatures

Beware of the rares for instant speed creatures that may eat one of your smaller creatures if you attack into them. The uncommon is listed mainly as a chumper here.

- Commence the Endgame
- Awakening of Vitu-Ghazi
- Lazotep Plating

## Edicts

Opponents may offer decent trades to get you to a single creature in order to use one of these to full effect. Maybe you don't have to chump that one turn to expose the creature that is crucial to your game plan.

- Liliana, Dreadhorde General
