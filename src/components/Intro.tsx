        In Limited Magic, your opponent will oftentimes do something that
        doesn't make sense according to what's on the board. When your opponent
        attacks their 2/2 into your 3/3 they're up to something. Assuming that
        your opponent is not bluffing, there are limited possibilities to what
        could be going on.

        This website is intended to help you learn the instants in the set,
        practice that knowledge or potentially as a tool figure out what your
        opponent has during a game.
